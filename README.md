# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Hi there! My name is Fernando Bertoncello Bellelis and I am a data science student. I am passionate about using data to drive meaningful insights and solutions.

On my profile, you'll find a variety of projects that showcase my skills and interests in data science. From analyzing and visualizing datasets to building machine learning models, I enjoy tackling a wide range of challenges in this field.

I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a data scientist. If you have a project that you think would be a good fit for me, or if you just want to connect and chat about data science, don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks for stopping by!

## Skills

- Data analysis and visualization with tools such as `Python`, `R`, and `SQL`
- Machine learning with libraries such as `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, and `PyTorch`
- Data wrangling and cleaning with `pandas` and `NumPy`
- Collaborating on projects using version control with `git`

## Projects

- Genetic Algorithm: (https://github.com/nandobb1411/Genetic_Algorithm): A project that I did with some friends, uses genetics as inspiration to solve problems using code, this algorithm is a mere example.
- MLP Churn: (https://github.com/nandobb1411/MLP_Churn): A prediction machine learning model that predicts churn(when a customer stop using a product or service)
- there are more projects on my profile, feel free to check them out!
